# SE-DAY5-Technical-Writing
## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?

>Depending on the audience at hand will really point you to the way you present your work

  understand what you  are doing.They may need a manual of what you are talking about to keep 
  on refering if they are doing the correct thing.

 concept sinks in and you can go foward with your presentation , no deep explanations 
 needed.They can simply understand what to do if they a little light of your idea.
